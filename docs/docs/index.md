# Welcome to MolViewStories

MolViewStories is a powerful web application that lets you create beautiful, interactive molecular visualizations. Whether you're a researcher, educator, or student, MolViewStories helps you tell compelling scientific stories using 3D molecular structures.

## What is MolViewStories?

MolViewStories combines the advanced 3D rendering capabilities of [Mol*](https://molstar.org/) with a story-building interface for the [MolViewSpec](https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec) standard. It allows you to:

- **Create interactive molecular scenes** with proteins, DNA, RNA, and small molecules
- **Build narrative sequences** that guide viewers through complex molecular processes
- **Add custom annotations** like labels, highlights, and descriptions
- **Share your stories** with colleagues, students, or the broader scientific community
- **Export and reuse** your visualizations across different platforms

## Who Should Use MolViewStories?

### Researchers & Scientists
Perfect for creating publication-quality figures, presenting research findings, or explaining complex molecular mechanisms to peers.

### Educators & Teachers
Ideal for developing engaging educational content that helps students understand molecular biology, biochemistry, and structural biology concepts.

### Students & Learners
Great for exploring molecular structures, creating study materials, or completing assignments that require molecular visualization.

## Key Features

### üé® Code-driven Scene Builder
Create molecular scenes with a built-in JavaScript code editor to control molecular representations, animations, and interactions. Get full access to [MolViewSpec](https://molstar.org/mol-view-spec) powerful API for advanced customizations.

### üìö Interactive Storytelling
Combine multiple scenes into cohesive stories with descriptions, annotations, and smooth transitions between different molecular views.

### üîó Share Molecular Stories
Publish your stories for sharing or embedding in presentations and websites.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Storage
Save your work in the cloud, access it from anywhere, and collaborate with others by sharing story links.

## What Problems Does MolViewStories Solve?

**Static Images Are Limiting**: Traditional molecular figures in papers and presentations are static. MolViewStories creates interactive visualizations that readers can explore.

**Complex Software Barriers**: Professional molecular visualization software often has steep learning curves. MolViewStories provides an accessible interface while maintaining powerful capabilities.

**Storytelling Challenges**: It's hard to explain complex molecular processes with single images. MolViewStories lets you create step-by-step narratives that guide viewers through molecular mechanisms.

**Sharing Difficulties**: Sharing molecular visualizations typically requires specialized software. MolViewStories creates web-based stories that work in any browser.

## How It Works

1. **Load molecular structures** from online databases or upload your own files
2. **Create scenes** by positioning the camera, focusing regions of interest, and choosing visual representations
3. **Add annotations** like labels, highlights, and descriptive text
4. **Build your story** by combining scenes in a logical sequence
5. **Share or export** your completed story for others to explore
