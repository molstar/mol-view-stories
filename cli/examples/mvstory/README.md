# MVStory Test Files

This directory contains compiled `.mvstory` files used for testing the CLI's ability to load, parse, and manipulate binary MVStory container formats.

## Purpose

These files are used by the test suite (`tests/mvstory.test.ts` and `tests/equivalence.test.ts`) to verify:

- Loading binary `.mvstory` container files
- Converting between formats (mvstory ↔ JSON ↔ HTML ↔ MVS)
- Round-trip conversion integrity
- Story manipulation after loading from binary format
- Asset extraction and handling from container files

## Files

- **exosome.mvstory** - Example story with molecular visualization of exosome structure
- **terms-of-entrapment.mvstory** - Example story demonstrating molecular entrapment

## Source

These files are copies of the compiled stories from `@mol-view-stories/webapp/public/examples/`. They are duplicated here specifically for CLI testing purposes to ensure the CLI can properly handle pre-built MVStory container files.

## Maintenance

If the source stories in the webapp are updated, these test files should be updated accordingly:

```bash
# From the project root
cp @mol-view-stories/webapp/public/examples/exosome/story.mvstory cli/examples/mvstory/exosome.mvstory
cp @mol-view-stories/webapp/public/examples/terms-of-entrapment/story.mvstory cli/examples/mvstory/terms-of-entrapment.mvstory
```

## Note

These are binary files and should not be edited manually. They are generated by building story folders using the CLI's `build` command.
