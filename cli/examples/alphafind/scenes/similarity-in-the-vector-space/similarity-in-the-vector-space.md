# Similarity in the vector space

The distance in this space corresponds to similarity in structure. This makes it possible to compare proteins quickly by computing distances between their vectors, instead of aligning full 3D structures atom by atom.

We can see that the vector representation of our [Cytochrome P450 from Maize](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/AF-A0A1D6JW22-F1) is very close to several other protein vector embeddings - these are other Cytochromes P450 that naturally appear close in the space.
