# Fast similarity of protein structures

Cytochromes are enzymes important for the metabolism of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. P450 enzymes have been identified across all biological kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, bacteria and archaea, as well as in viruses. There is a catch, however, [their sequence similarity is very low](https://www.uniprot.org/uniprotkb/A0A1D6JW22/entry#similar_proteins). 

In this story, we dive into the cytochromes of various organisms which have similar structures despite low sequence identity. We will do so in the vast [AlphaFold Protein Structure Database](alphafold.ebi.ac.uk) of predicted structures through [Alpha**Find**](https://alphafind.fi.muni.cz/search?q=A0A1D6JW22&limit=50), a similarity search engine for fast structural similarity.

Our starting point is Cytochrome from corn (Zea Mays), [A0A1D6JW22](https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/entry/A0A1D6JW22).
