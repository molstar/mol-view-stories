# The vector space

In the vector space, each protein becomes a point whose position reflects its structural and chemical characteristics. Proteins with similar shapes or residue environments appear close together, while those with different folds or properties lie farther apart.

The embedding from [Greener et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioadv/vbaf042) has 128 dimensions, we visualize a simplified 3D version here.
