# Local File Visualization

This scene demonstrates loading a molecular structure from a local PDB file (1fab.pdb) stored in the assets directory. The structure is displayed with a blue cartoon representation for the polymer chains and orange ball-and-stick for any ligands present.

This showcases the MVSX format capability where molecular data files are bundled together with the story configuration as a single zipfile package.
