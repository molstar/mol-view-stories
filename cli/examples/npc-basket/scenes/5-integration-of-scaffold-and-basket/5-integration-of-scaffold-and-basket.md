### 5. Integration of Scaffold and Basketâ€‹

The core **Nup84 complex** scaffold attaches itself to the nuclear
membrane. The **distal and proximal arms** of the Nup84 complex
serve as attachment points for anchor Nups and thus indirectly link
to the basket. These interactions reinforce the notion that the
basket is not an appendage but an integrated and essential
extension of the NPC scaffold.
