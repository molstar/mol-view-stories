### 4. NPC as a Suspension Bridge​

The NPC basket architecture remarkably mirrors that of a suspension bridge. In this analogy, **Nup60** acts as the *suspension cable*, extending horizontally and linking the **Mlp proteins** to the **nuclear ring** via a complex meshwork involving **Nup1** and **Nup2**.​

**Nup60**, positioned at the nuclear ring, spans laterally and recruits **Nup2** and **Nup1**, functioning like hangers that connect the suspension cable to the basket’s vertical support.​

**Nup2**, attaches to Nup60 and nuclear ring, forms an interaction hub. It plays both structural and regulatory roles in basket assembly and transport functions.​

**Nup1** resides on the periphery, modulating the dynamics of the basket and interacting with cargo complexes during mRNA export.
