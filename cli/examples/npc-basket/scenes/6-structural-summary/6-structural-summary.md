### 6. Structural Summary

This integrative model reveals how three key anchor proteins—**Nup1**, **Nup2**, and **Nup60**—coordinate the spatial organization of the basket.​

**Nup60** tethers the basket filaments to the nuclear ring.​

**Nup2** acts as a linker and signal integrator.​

**Nup1** extends the interface toward the nuclear interior and likely modulates transport and surveillance functions.
