### 1. The Story of the NPC Basket: A Gatekeeper with Hidden Complexity

The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is not just a passive channel—it’s a dynamic hub for communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm. At its nuclear face lies the *NPC basket*, a structure long observed but only recently understood in structural and functional detail.

Through integrative modeling, we now reveal the architecture of the yeast NPC basket in unprecedented resolution.

This story unfolds the basket’s hidden complexity—showing how it is:
- **Anchored and assembled** at the nuclear ring,
- **Composed of flexible, modular domains**,
- **Tethered by nucleoporins** in a suspension-bridge-like configuration,
- And **positioned to regulate cargo transport and RNA quality control** within the nuclear landscape.

In this story, we’ll explore how form meets function in the NPC basket—and how this essential structure is not simply attached to the NPC, but integrated into its very logic.
