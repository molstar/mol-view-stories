### 7. Basket Flexibility and Composition

Zooming in, the flexible Mlp filaments reveal distinct **N-terminal (blue)** and **C-terminal (red)** domains, organized along a coiled path. These filaments are anchored to the nuclear ring, with their N- and C-termini forming looped, possibly dynamic distal rings that help regulate mRNA export and quality control.â€‹

This ordered but flexible organization enables the basket to respond to different transport states and molecular cues within the nucleus.
