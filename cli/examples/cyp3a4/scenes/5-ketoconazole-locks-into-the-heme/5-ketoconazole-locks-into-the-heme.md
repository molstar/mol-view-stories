## 5. Ketoconazole Locks into the Heme
As the molecule of ketoconazole lodges into the enzyme’s deep interior, it’s not alone—another ketoconazole molecule is stacked neatly above, symbolizing CYP3A4’s unique ability to host multiple molecules at once. This remarkable feature allows the enzyme to handle complex drug interactions, acting as both a metabolizer and a modulator. Imagine CYP3A4 as a busy gateway, not just passively accepting one molecule but capable of managing several—each ligand influencing and competing with the others. This capacity for multiple binding sites underpins its notorious role in drug-drug interactions, making it a flexible yet formidable player in the story of human biochemistry.
