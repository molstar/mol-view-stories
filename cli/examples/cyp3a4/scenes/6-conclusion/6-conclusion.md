## 6. Conclusion
CYP3A4 serves as a central and versatile enzyme in xenobiotic metabolism, capable of accommodating and processing a wide spectrum of structurally diverse compounds. Its intrinsic structural flexibility and ability to bind multiple ligands simultaneously underlie its broad substrate specificity and complex kinetic behavior. These features contribute significantly to its dominant role in drug metabolism, influencing both therapeutic efficacy and adverse drug interactions.
