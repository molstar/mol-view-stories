## 3. Substrate Access Tunnels: Pathways to the Catalytic Core

Deep within CYP3A4, multiple tunnels provide essential pathways for substrates to reach the buried active site and for products to exit after metabolism. These tunnels are surrounded by flexible structural elements, particularly the F and G helices, which can shift to allow ligands to enter the tunnels, which can open or close depending on conformational changes in CYP3A4, reflecting its adaptability. This network of tunnels is key to CYP3A4’s remarkable ability to accommodate a diverse array of substrates and inhibitors, reinforcing its role as the universal processor in drug metabolism. According to [ChannelsDB](http://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkad1012),from many identified tunnels in 2V0M by [MOLE](https://doi.org/10.1093/nar/gky309) and [CAVER](https://caver.cz/), the selected ones from reviewed channels MOLE and Cofactor tunnels MOLE include channels 1, 2b, 2c, 2e, 2f, 4, and Solvent channel.
