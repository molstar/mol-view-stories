## 4. Ketoconazole's Journey: Navigating the Tunnel
This animation follows a single ketoconazole molecule as it travels through one of the access tunnels leading to CYP3A4’s deeply buried active site. Although simplified, it demonstrates the principle of substrate or inhibitor movement within the enzyme’s internal pathways. The enzyme’s network of tunnels, shaped by rigid and flexible protein regions, guides molecules like ketoconazole on their journey to the catalytic core. The conformation of CYP without ligand is shown in white (PDB ID: 1TQN). This visualization highlights how CYP3A4 accommodates diverse compounds, underpinning its role in metabolizing many drugs.
