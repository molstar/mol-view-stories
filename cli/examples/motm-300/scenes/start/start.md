# Molecule of the Month: Flagellar Motor

**Bidirectional motors power the swimming of many bacterial cells.**

## Introduction

In this **300th installment** of the *Molecule of the Month*, we explore newly revealed atomic details of one of the wonders of the biomolecular world, the **bacterial flagellar motor**.  

Flagellar motors have fascinated biologists for decades. These are **huge molecular assemblies**, composed of about **20 types of proteins**, which together form **rotary motors** strong enough to spin long, corkscrew-shaped flagella many times the length of the cell.  

The *Salmonella* motor shown here turns at an astonishing **18,000 revolutions per minute** — and some bacteria spin even faster! At this speed, movement is invisible to the eye—so here, the motion is slowed by a factor of 1,000 to make it visible.

## Moving Parts

Flagellar motors contain many intricate, interlocking components studied through **X-ray crystallography** and **cryo-electron microscopy**.

The model here shows the **clockwise form of the motor**, combining several **PDB entries**:  
[`8UCS`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UCS),  
[`8UPL`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UPL),  
[`7CGO`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/7CGO),  
[`2ZVY`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/2ZVY),  
[`1F4V`](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1F4V).

At the **top**, the [**hook**](!highlight-refs=hook&focus-refs=hook) connects the motor to the long flagellum.  
The [**LP ring**](!highlight-refs=lpring&focus-refs=lpring) surrounds the central axle, reducing friction with the **outer membrane** and **peptidoglycan**.  

Power is generated by about **11 rotary [stator](!highlight-refs=motabrep0,motabrep1,motabrep2,motabrep3,motabrep4,motabrep5,motabrep6,motabrep7,motabrep8,motabrep9,motabrep10&focus-refs=motabrep0,motabrep1,motabrep2,motabrep3,motabrep4,motabrep5,motabrep6,motabrep7,motabrep8,motabrep9,motabrep10) units** — each itself a tiny motor driven by **proton flow** across the inner membrane. These stators together turn the large [**C-ring**](!highlight-refs=cring&focus-refs=cring), which rotates the central axle and the attached flagellum.

Finally, **[CheY](!highlight-refs=chey&focus-refs=chey) proteins** act as molecular switches that determine **rotation direction**, toggling between **clockwise (CW)** and **counterclockwise (CCW)** modes. 


See the [next slide](#switch) for the rotation switch.
