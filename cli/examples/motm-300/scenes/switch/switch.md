## Changing Course

Remarkably, bacteria **steer their swimming direction** by reversing the rotation of their flagellar motors.

- *Salmonella* and *E. coli* have about **ten flagella** scattered around the surface of the cell.  
- When the motor turns **counterclockwise**, the flagella **bundle together** and power the cell forward.  
- When the motor switches to **clockwise**, the bundle **breaks apart**, and the cell **tumbles** randomly.  
- Switching back to **counterclockwise** re-bundles the flagella, sending the cell off in a **new direction**.

This simple mechanical reversal allows bacteria to navigate their environment through a process known as **chemotaxis**, moving toward favorable conditions and away from harmful ones.

## Switching Direction

The motor switches rotation with a direct approach that is quite similar to machines in our macroscale world. The [C-ring](!highlight-refs=cring&focus-refs=cring) acts like a large gear and the stators act like smaller gears. In the counterclockwise state, shown below at the top from PDB ID [8UOX](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UOX) and [8UCS](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UCS), the [stators](!highlight-refs=motabrep20,motabrep21,motabrep22,motabrep23,motabrep24,motabrep25,motabrep26,motabrep27,motabrep28,motabrep29,motabrep210&focus-refs=motabrep20,motabrep21,motabrep22,motabrep23,motabrep24,motabrep25,motabrep26,motabrep27,motabrep28,motabrep29,motabrep210)  are positioned outside the C-ring, and when the gears mesh the C-ring is driven in the opposite direction from the stator rotation. When [CheY](!highlight-refs=chey&focus-refs=chey) binds, the shape of the C-ring changes slightly and the stator binds on the inside of the ring ([8UPL](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UPL), [8UCS](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/8UCS), [1F4V](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1F4V)). In that position, the C-ring is driven in the same direction as the rotation of the stator.
