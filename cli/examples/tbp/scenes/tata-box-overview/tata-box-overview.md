### TATA-Binding Protein Binds to the Minor Groove of the TATA Box

When the first structures of TBP-DNA complexes were determined, researchers discovered that TBP is not gentle when it binds to DNA.
Instead, it grabs the TATA sequence, bends and unwinds it to open up the minor groove, and kinks it sharply in two places (*e.g.*, [PDB ID 1VTL](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1vtl/pdb)) and ([PDB ID 1CDW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1cdw/pdb)). 

Interactions with the minor groove can be divided into different classes as seen in PDB ([PDB ID 1CDW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1cdw/pdb)).
The combination of interactions allows TATA-binding protein to recognize the proper DNA sequence.
