### TATA-Binding Protein and the Transcription Pre-Initiation Complex

The structure shown here, from [PDB ID 7ENC](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb7enc/pdb), is that of a pol II "pre-initiation complex" (PIC) poised to start transcription.
This complex includes eukaryotic Mediator and pol II, along with a collection of general transcription factors that perform the necessary tasks of recognizing the transcription start site of genes, separating the two strands of the DNA double helix, and facilitating transcription initiation by RNA polymerase II.

TBP starts the process of assembling the PIC and works with TBP-associated factors (TAFs) as part of a large multi-component transcription factor, TFIID, that belongs to the collection of general transcription factors that cradle pol II with in the PIC.
After TBP binds to the promoter, it recruits additional transcription factors.
TFIIA and TFIIB interact with surrounding regions of the DNA and, along with TFIIF, assist with positioning of RNA polymerase II at the transcription start site.
TFIIE, TFIIH, and other TFIID subunits bring additional functionality to the complex.
In particular, part of TFIIH is a translocase that separates the two strands of DNA in preparation for transcription, and the CAK module of TFIIH adds phosphate groups to the long tail of RNA polymerase II, sending the signal that it is time to get started with mRNA synthesis. 

TBP is a critical player that gets the transcription process started and is central to the pre-initiation complex.
Lying at the very heart of this complex macromolecular machine, it is highly conserved among eukaryotes and *archaea*.
