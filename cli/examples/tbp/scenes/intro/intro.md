### TATA-Binding Protein Tells RNA Polymerase Where To Get Started on a Gene

Specialized DNA sequences next to genes, called promoters, define the proper start site and direction for transcription.
Promoters vary in sequence and location from organism to organism.
In eukaryotic cells, a complex promoter system that uses dozens of different proteins ensures that the proper RNA polymerase is targeted to each gene.
The TATA-binding protein (TBP) is the central element of this system, participating in transcription by all three RNA polymerases.

The crystal structure of TBP from *Arabidopsis thaliana* in its apo form is shown ([PDB ID 1VOK](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1vok/pdb)).
The structure reveals a highly symmetric DNA-binding fold composed of two topologically identical domains derived from the two direct repeats in the phylogenetically conserved sequence.
The domains are related by an approximate 2-fold axis, and consist of a five-stranded, antiparallel beta sheet and two alpha helices.
It is thought that an ancient gene duplication created this protein by combining two copies of the same gene. 

The intramolecular symmetry generates a saddle-shaped structure dominated by a curved antiparallel beta sheet, which forms the saddle's concave face and interacts with the DNA.
The convex face of the saddle would interact with other proteins during transcription initiation.
