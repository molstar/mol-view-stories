### TATA-Binding Protein Is Highly Conserved in Eukaryotes

TBP has a phylogenetically conserved, 180 amino-acid carboxy-terminal domain (ranging from 38 to 93% identity among eukaryotes and archaebacteria), containing two structural repeats flanking a highly basic segment known as the basic repeat.
The C-terminal or core portion of the protein binds the TATA consensus sequence with high affinity, interacting with the minor groove and promoting DNA bending.
Structural superposition of TBP bound to DNA in human ([PDB ID 1CDW](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1cdw/pdb)) and *A. thaliana* ([PDB ID 1VTL](https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1vtl/pdb)) shows that their sequences are 83% identical and the RMSD between the structures is 0.43 Ã….
