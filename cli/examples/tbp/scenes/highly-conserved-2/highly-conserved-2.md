### TATA-Binding Protein Is Highly Conserved in Eukaryotes

Eukaryotic protein-coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II (pol II) have a characteristic sequence of nucleotides, termed the TATA box, in front of the start site of transcription.
The typical sequence is something like T-A-T-A-a/t-A-a/t, where a/t refers to positions that can be either A or T.
TBP recognizes this TATA sequence and binds to it, creating a landmark that directs pol II to the transcription start site. 
The structures of *A. thaliana* and human core TBP-TATA element co-crystal structures demonstrate a common induced-fit mechanism of protein-DNA recognition involving subtle conformation changes in the protein and an unprecedented DNA distortion.
