11 sequences are now known from different species.
Here we compare the sequences from the bovine and human enzymes where the red regions represent
the most variable changes in sequence and the green regions represent conserved areas.

Superoxide dismutase forms a Greek-key beta barrel which contains eight extended beta
strands shown in green connected by red loop regions.

The two red loops shown in the front represent the active side of the enzyme.

Here we look at two-dimensional schematic and a three-dimensional view on top of the three-dimensional
arrangement of the atoms in one subunit.
