We focus in on the strands making up the [beta barrel or beta sandwich](!query%3Dchain%20O%20and%20ss%20S%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus), there are four which we show independent surfaces for which are fairly regular extended beta strands with good hydrogen bonding.

The other four strands are less regular and more twisted have more irregular hydrogen bonding
and form the beta barrel facing into the active side of a molecule.

We depict all eight beta strands simultaneously and show thin cross sections perpendicular
to the axis of the barrel.
