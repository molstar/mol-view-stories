The two subunits are related by a two-fold symmetry axis shown as a vertical red line on the screen.

Each subunit contains two metal ions, a [copper](!query%3Dname%20CU%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus) and a [zinc](!query%3Dname%20ZN%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus) which are shown as spheres along
with the alpha-carbon trace of one subunit.
