# Terms of Entrapment

At siggraph 1985, Arthur Olson, John Tainer and Elizabeth Getzoof show a movie entitled ["Terms of Entrapment"](https://history.siggraph.org/animation-video-pod/terms-of-entrapment-by-olson-tainer-and-getzoff/). This film details the graphics research done on the structure and function of superoxide dismutase, an enzyme superoxide that scavenges the harmful by-product of oxygen metabolism before it can do damage to the organism. The film was done with the software GRAMPS developed
by T.J. O?Donnell and A.J. Olson. GRANNY and the molecular modeling system by M.L. Connolly and A.J. Olson. This historic molecular animation was filmed directly off the E&S color monitor using a Mitchell 16mm animation camera and all animation was done using GRAMPS.

Here we tried to reproduce key moment of the animation in molstar leveraging molviewspec language. We use bloom and emissive effect to reproduce the look and feel of the 16mm projected film. Simply navigate through the scene or hit the play button and discover about the superoxide dismutase structure.
