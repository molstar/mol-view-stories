Using molecules govern biological functions in all living systems.
X-ray crystallographic studies reveal the arrangement of atoms forming the three-dimensional
protein structure and allow us to examine the relationship between structure and biological
function.


In this movie, we use computer graphics to illustrate the three-dimensional structure
and function of the enzyme superoxide dismutase which protects all aerobic organisms against
toxic byproducts of oxygen metabolism.


Superoxide dismutase is a dimeric molecule having two identical subunits of 151 amino
acids or 2200 atoms.

PDB id 2SOD from E. D. Getzoff, J. A. Tainer, P. K. Weiner, P. A. Kollman, J. S. Richardson and D. C. Richardson (1983) Electrostatic recognition between superoxide and copper, zinc superoxide dismutase. Nature 306, 287-290.
 
SOD stands for superoxide dismutase, an enzyme that catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. It is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen.

It is a symmetrical dimer with identical [chain A](!query%3Dchain%20O%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus) and [chain B](!query%3Dchain%20Y%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus).
