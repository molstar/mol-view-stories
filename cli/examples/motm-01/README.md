# Molecule of the Month: Myoglobin

Recreation of the inaugural [RCSB PDB Molecule of the Month](https://pdb101.rcsb.org/motm/1) by David Goodsell (January 2000), exploring myoglobinâ€”the first protein structure ever solved.

## About Myoglobin

Myoglobin stores and transports oxygen in muscle tissue. Its structure determination by John Kendrew (1962 Nobel Prize) opened the door to atomic-level understanding of proteins.

**Key Features:**
- Compact globular protein with 8 alpha helices
- Heme group with iron atom binds oxygen
- Hydrophobic core, charged surface residues
- Stabilized by salt bridges
