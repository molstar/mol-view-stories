# Molecule of the Month: Myoglobin

Myoglobin was the first protein to have its atomic structure determined, revealing how it stores oxygen in muscle cells.

## The First Protein Structure

Any discussion of protein structure must necessarily begin with **myoglobin**, because it is where the science of protein structure began. After years of arduous work, *John Kendrew* and his coworkers determined the atomic structure of myoglobin, laying the foundation for an era of biological understanding.

You can take a close look at this protein structure yourself, in **PDB entry [1mbn](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1MBN)**. You will be amazed—just like the world was in 1960—at the beautiful intricacy of this protein.

## Myoglobin and Muscles

[Myoglobin](!query%3Dchain%20A%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus) is a **small, bright red protein**. It is very common in muscle cells and gives meat much of its red color. Its job is to **store oxygen**, for use when muscles are hard at work.

To do this, it uses a special chemical tool to capture slippery oxygen molecules: a **[heme group](!query%3Dresn%20HEM%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus)**. Heme is a disk-shaped molecule with a hole in the center that is perfect for holding an iron ion. The iron then forms a strong interaction with the **[oxygen molecule](!query%3Dresn%20OH%26lang%3Dpymol%26action%3Dhighlight%2Cfocus)**. As you can see in the structure, the heme group is held tightly in a deep pocket on one side of the protein.

## Visualizing Protein Structure

When the structure of myoglobin was solved, it posed a great challenge. The structure is so complex that **new methods** needed to be developed to display and understand it.

- *John Kendrew* used a huge wire model to build the structure based on the experimental electron density.  
- Then, the artist *Irving Geis* was employed to create a picture of myoglobin for a prominent article in *Scientific American*.  
- Computer graphics were still many years in the future, so he created this illustration entirely by hand—one atom at a time.
