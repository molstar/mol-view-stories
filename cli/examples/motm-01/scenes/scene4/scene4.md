# Oxygen Bound to Myoglobin

A later structure of myoglobin, PDB entry [1mbo](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1mbo), 
shows that oxygen binds to the iron atom deep inside the protein. 
So how does it get in and out? The 
answer is that the structure in the PDB is only one snapshot of the 
protein, caught when it is in a tightly-closed form. In reality, 
myoglobin (and all other proteins) is constantly in motion, performing 
small flexing and breathing motions (illustrated here by PDB entry [1myf](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1myf)). So, temporary openings constantly 
appear and disappear, allowing oxygen in and out.
