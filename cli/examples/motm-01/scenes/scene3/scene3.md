# Myoglobin and Whales

If you look at John Kendrew's PDB file, you'll notice that the myoglobin he used was taken 
from sperm whale muscles. Whales and dolphin have a great need for myoglobin, so that they can 
store extra oxygen for use in their deep undersea dives. Typically, they have about 30 
times more than in animals that live on land. A recent study revealed that a few special 
modifications are needed to make this possible.

Comparing whale myoglobin (PDB entry [1mbn](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1mbn)) with 
pig myoglobin (PDB entry [1pmb](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1pmb)), we find that there are 
several mutations that add extra positively-charged amino acids to the surface. Marine animals typically have these extra charges on 
the surface of their myoglobin to help repel neighboring molecules and prevent aggregation when myoglobin is at 
high concentrations.
