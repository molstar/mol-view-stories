# Exosome Envelope
The envelope proteins of exosomes are crucial for their functionality. They are not only structural components that maintain the integrity and specificity of the vesicle, but also active participants in the exosome's journey. These proteins facilitate targeted delivery by binding to recipient cells, initiating signal transduction, and engaging with the immune system. Understanding these proteins is key to unlocking the therapeutic and diagnostic potential of exosomes, as they hold the code to where and how exosomes exert their influence within the body.
- **[Tetraspanins CD63, CD81, CD9](!highlight-refs=CD&focus-refs=CD)**: These surface proteins are key in the structural formation of exosomes, aiding in the encapsulation and sorting of molecular cargo. They are also implicated in cell-to-cell communication and adhesion.

- **[Integrins ITG](!highlight-refs=ITG&focus-refs=ITG)**: Integrins are integral to the exosome's ability to interact with other cells, playing a pivotal role in cell adhesion and the initiation of various signaling pathways, which can impact cellular behavior and immune responses.

- **[Small GTPases RAB5A, RAB7A](!highlight-refs=RAB&focus-refs=RAB)**: RAB proteins are vital in the regulation of exosomal trafficking, overseeing the endocytic pathways and the delivery of exosomes to specific sites, thereby influencing intercellular communication.

- **[Gprotein](!highlight-refs=Gprotein&focus-refs=Gprotein)**: Guanine nucleotide-binding proteins act as molecular switches, conducting signals from outside the cell to the interior, initiating various intracellular processes.

- **[HLAI/HLAII](!highlight-refs=HLA&focus-refs=HLA)**: Major Histocompatibility Complex Proteins are crucial for the immune system's ability to detect and present foreign antigens, mediating the adaptive immune responses facilitated by exosomes.
