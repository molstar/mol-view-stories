# Explore the structural model of an Exosome.

Exosomes are small nanovesicles that are released by most cell types into blood, urine, saliva, breast milk, and other bodily fluids [Raposo and Stoorvogel 2013](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23420871). For much of the 30 years since their discovery, they have been described as garbage shuttles, but recent studies have revealed their role in cell communication and they are now seen as information shuttles [Huang-Doran et al. 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27810172). Exosomes are currently the subject of intense study as they are showing great promise for discovery of, for example, new approaches for cancer diagnosis and therapy [Barile and Vassalli 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28202367).
